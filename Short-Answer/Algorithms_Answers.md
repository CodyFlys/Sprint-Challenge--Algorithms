## Exercise I

a) O(n), The size of a is proportional to the size of n so it's o(n)


b) O(nlog(n)) The outer loop grows proportionally with the input size. the the inner loop is O(log(n)), because
 it is half of whatever the input is.


c) it has recusion that is affected by the input size aka n. It will run x amount of times based off of n
